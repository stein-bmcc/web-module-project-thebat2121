    <h1>You chose to go to the Inn</h1>
    <p>Dog tired, you enter the inn hoping to get a room. But a sinking feeling hits your chest the moment you enter:You don't have any money.You look at the sign above the front desk, none of the prices give you any comfort. Even the cheapest purchase feels embarrassingly too much for you. </p>
    <p>"Come forward weary one". The voice snaps you from the slackjaw gaze you held towards the menu down to the front desk. The innkeeper waves you over. You trod your way to the front desk. The innkeeper looks at you up and down, discerns you're in need with no way to traditionally pay for it, and ultimatley hands you a broom and a dust bin.</p>
    <p>The task is clear, tidy the Inn and receive a place to stay for the night. You clean and clean doggedly until you can no longer spot any dust, dirt particles, or any other contaminant. The Innkeeper looks around, impressed by your handiwork;you are too surpringly. They hand you a key with a warm smile. Somehow, that smile felt better than any words of thanks the Innkeeper could say.</p>
    <p>As you settle in your room with an odd contemporary asthetic compared to the Inn, you collapse in the bed. You think to yourself how you could've collapsed the same way in the snow had you not continuned forward.This fills you with warm pride,you're safe and sound now. You doze off to sleep listening to the Tavern next door, laughter and joyful banter emitting from its walls. Time for a Good Nights Rest.  </p>

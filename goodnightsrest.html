    <h1>You chose to go to the Inn</h1>
    <p>Dog tired, you enter the inn hoping to get a room. But a sinking feeling hits your chest the moment you enter:You don't have any money.You look at the sign above the front desk, none of the prices give you any comfort. Even the cheapest purchase feels embarrassingly too much for you. </p>
    <p>"Come forward weary one". The voice snaps you from the slackjaw gaze you held towards the menu down to the front desk. The innkeeper waves you over. </p>

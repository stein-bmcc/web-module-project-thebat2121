<h1>A Fork in the Road</h1>
<p>You have been walking in this forest for a long time. It almost feels like a dream, you don't know how you got here, but you know you must get out. You approach a fork in the road, both paths seem indistinguishable from one another. The light is fading fast, you must make a decision.</p>
<h2>Which will you choose?</h2>

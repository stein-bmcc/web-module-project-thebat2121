    <h1>You chose the Right path</h1>
    <p>You venture through the Right path and already you feel the atmosphere changing. There's a glow not too far away. You feel a sense of adrenaline after seeing a sign of life other than the wild animals that were in the forest. Quickly, you tredge through the snow and finally arrive at the Village.</p>
    <p>It's a sleepy town, tucked away where it seems like the common person cannot find it. But you aren't a common person. The villge seems lively but most of the structures are homes, filled with people getting ready for the night.</p>
    <p>Something catches your eye however, two buildings with an "Open" sign hagning outside. One looks like a Tavern of sorts and the other an Inn.</p>
    <h2>Where will you go?</h2>

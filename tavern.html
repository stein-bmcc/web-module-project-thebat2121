        <h1>You chose to go to the Tavern</h1>
        <p>You enter the Tavern, to your surpirse it is decently filled. The townsfolk are so busy with their conversations they don't notice you-an outsider- walk in. You take a seat at the bar. The bartender asks what you fancy. Stumpt, you order what you see everyone else drinking: a large beer. You've never drank alcohol before but you figured why not, you just escaped certain death after all.</p>
        <p>The more you drink the more confident in your social skills you become. To continue with this night of firsts, you ask a nearby group-beaming with laughter- if you could join them. They allow you to sit with them and thus begins a long night of drinking,socialization,ending with a watch party. You black out afterthe show and after a couple more beers.</p>
        <p>You wake in the morning, your head is spinning and you have a sour taste in your mouth. A mixture of throw up and Lager.Your alone aside from the bartender cleaning up after a rowdy night. He speaks to you "Your friends wanted to give this to you, you were prattling pretty hard during your drunken stupor" he says with a sly smile.</p>
        <p>He slides a napkin with messy but intelligible writing, it reads:</p>
        <p>The Tavern <br>
            I’m on my lonesome <br>
            The night tempest never ceases <br>
            My hands are as stiff as a rose gum <br>
             <br>
            The frost has me blinded <br>
            My search will have to wait <br>
            I focus on finding safeguard, my attention is undivided   <br>
             <br>
            I look ahead and see in bits and pieces <br>
            The loveliest little glowing tavern in a village <br>
            My pace expeditiously increases  <br>
             <br>
            Upon entering, the warmth overwhelmed me <br>
            The veiled light dims my vision <br>
            I feel, this, is where I’m supposed to be <br>
             <br>
            The place is crowded, I wander to find a seat <br>
            “Can I get you something sir?” says the barkeep <br>
            Eagerly I say “Anything warm would help me feel complete”  <br>
             <br>
            As I wander about, looking to occupy my time <br>
            A small projector sits in the corner, preparing to be used <br>
            People huddle around, “Show is going to start!” someone chimed <br>
             <br>
            We all settle down, agreeing to the unspoken troth <br>
            Transfixed on the screen, the images go in all directions <br>
            The beam of light turns us all into moths <br>
             <br>
            The show is over, the crowd disperses for discourse <br>
            I leave to ponder on my own <br>
            “What did you think?” I’m asked, stopping me midcourse <br>
             <br>
            The patron and I spoke of the show, a conversation most profound <br>
            A fellow patron wished to join in as well <br>
            Contrary to popular belief three is not a crowd <br>
             <br>
            By the time it was after hours we were four, talking strong <br>
            Who knew such complete strangers can have much in common <br>
            Who knew what I was searching for would be there all along <br>
             <br>
            Later on, we parted ways, having traded information to keep in touch <br>
            A small but important gesture of goodwill  <br>
            Something that, during these times, you can’t find much <br>
             <br>
            I awake, this journey has now come to its end <br>
            For even though we are all strangers <br>
            Something tells me that I have found what I was looking for… Friends!  
            </p>
            <p>At the bottom you see the signatures of the people you got to know of last night. You lay the napkin down with a melancholic smile. While it fills you with great warmth that you have made new friends, you also rememeber a time when you thought you would be alone forever. Look at how far you've come now. The light pours through the window, shining on you for the first time in a while. A new day awaits. </p>
